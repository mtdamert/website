- Bug: when a block is rotated when you're at the lowest height, it clips through the final row
- Start game + enable cookies screen
- Move high scores to back end
- Move block generation to back end
- Save top 5 scores
- Fancy animation on tetris (4-rows cleared at once)
- Inform player if they get a new high score
- Changing colors for screen -> make sure the screen is easy to make out
- Better background colors & block colors
- Record + replay mode
- Button to switch theme
- Add sounds


DONE:
- update graphics when a line is cleared
- First piece in game always goes one row too far (below the screen)
- unpause
- Top 5 scores - use an array
- If I play 3 games in a row, the scores from the 2 latest games will appear highlighted as if they're both the most recent game
- Don't list 0s on the high score list
